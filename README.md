# Linked List Odometer

Given a linked list of positive numbers, write a method, that "adds one" to the "number" represented by the list, like an odometer

## Sample inputs and outputs

```javascript
Input:
    4 -> 3 -> 9 -> 5

Output:
    4 -> 3 -> 9 -> 6
```

```javascript  
Input:
    4 -> 3 -> 4 -> 9

Output:
    4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 0
```

```javascript  
Input:
    9 -> 9 -> 9 -> 9

Output:
    1 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0
```

### Questions and Answers

* The list will always be positive integers
* You must modify the list IN PLACE
* You can assume they have a linked list class
* You will need to code the reverse method as well as the odometer logic
